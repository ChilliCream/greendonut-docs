Before we can start we have to install the package via _NuGet_. There are many ways to install a
_NuGet_ package but we focus here just on one for both _.net core_ and _classic_.

For _.net core_ we use the dotnet CLI. Which is perhaps the most preferred way to do this.

```powershell
dotnet add package GreenDonut
```

And for _.net classic_ we still use the following line.

```powershell
Install-Package GreenDonut
```
